## About Me

I am an experienced **Quality Assurance** professional with a proven track record as a **Release Coordinator** at **Ruangguru**, where I successfully streamlined release processes and improved product stability. My expertise lies in coordinating the end-to-end release of Android, iOS, and SaaS products (including CRM and HRIS systems), from development to post-launch monitoring. I am skilled in leading and mentoring QA teams to ensure high-quality product launches and collaborating with cross-functional teams to facilitate smooth, efficient releases with a strong focus on quality throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
